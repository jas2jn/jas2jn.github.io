### Projects Completed Through The University of Virginia

[Deep Learning Architecture for Text Classification](https://github.com/jas2jn/DeepLearningTextClassification/)
<img src="images/DeepLearningArchitectureImage.jpg?raw=true"/>
- This natural language processing model used a deep learning architecture to accurately predict 92% of high severity cases where users experienced adverse drug reactions to their medications.
- Through this architecture, a series of Convolutional Neural Networks are fused with a feed forward neural net. The fused model is then ensembled with a Convolutional Neural Network trained on word embeddings.

[Convolutional Neural Network for Image Recognition](https://github.com/jas2jn/CNN-for-Image-Recognition/)
<img src="images/CNNImage.jpg?raw=true"/>
- This Convolutional Neural Network Architecture was loosely based off of the VGG16 architecture [(More information on VGG16 here)](https://towardsdatascience.com/architecture-comparison-of-alexnet-vggnet-resnet-inception-densenet-beb8b116866d/).
- This model was used to predict whether an X-ray showed signs of pneumonia. 
- This model accurately predicted 99.92% of cases with pneumonia.

[Gradient Boosted Tree Model for Predicting Net Loss](https://github.com/jas2jn/GradientBoostingNetLoss/)
<img src="images/GradientBoosting.jpg?raw=true"/>
- A comparison between the performance of a Gradient Boosted Tree model to that of a LASSO regression model and a decision tree model.
- The Gradient Boosted Tree Model outperformed both models resulting in a lower root mean square error (RMSE) for predicting net loss in mortgages.
- The model was applied to Fannie Mae's Single-Family Loan Performance Data

[R Shiny Dashboard with Multiple Analyses](https://github.com/jas2jn/RShinyDashboard/)
<img src="images/RShinyDashboard.jpg?raw=true"/>
- This dashboard was created in R Shiny for a client as part of the graduate capstone requirement for my M.S. in Business Analytics
- The code found here was used to display and reformat publicly available data in the dashboard
- Any code referencing the client's private data has been removed. This code only serves as an example of my abilities in R Shiny.
- Thank you to Jess Roberts, Tracey Zhai, and Chip Kelly for working on this capstone with me.
